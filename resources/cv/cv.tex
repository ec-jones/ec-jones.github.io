I am a lecturer in programming languages and compilers at the University of Bristol.
My research to date has focused on lightweight methods for verifying functional programs, including refinement type systems and cyclic, equation reasoning.

Interests: \textbf{program logics}, \textbf{cyclic proofs}, \textbf{under-approximate reasoning}, \textbf{equational reasoning}.

\textbf{Lecturer in Programming Languages and Compilers --- University of Bristol} \hfill 2023--\phantom{2023}

\textbf{Research Associate on Taint-Analysis for Erlang --- University of Bristol} \hfill 2023--2023

\iflong
\vspace{-5pt}
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
  \item With funding from Meta, we are pursuing an extension of our intensional datatype refinement type system to Erlang. This project aims to statically approximate the flow of private information through a program in order to ensure compliance with data protection guidelines.
\end{itemize}
\fi

\textbf{Program-Level Teaching Assistant --- University of Bristol} \hfill 2021--2022

\iflong
\begin{itemize}
  \item As a program-level teaching assistant, I led tutorials designed to cross module boundaries and give students a more comprehensive understanding of computer science outside the curriculum. % These flexible sessions were particularly enjoyable as they could be catered to the students' needs and more naturally leads to a rapport.
  
  \item I also contributed content to this series, designing worksheets on bisimulation and the topological aspects of functional programming languages.
\end{itemize}
\fi

\textbf{Teaching Assistant --- University of Bristol} \hfill 2018--2023

\iflong
\begin{itemize}
  \item During my undergraduate degree and PhD, I took the opportunity to be a teaching assistant across a number of units including:

            \end{itemize}
          \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

        This role involved leading tutorial-like problem classes, helping the students with lab working, as well as marking homework sheets.
  
  \item For the Functional Programming and Types \& Lambda Calculus units, I have previously taken on the additional responsibility as lead teaching assistant with associated administrative duties and the task of checking the exam solutions.
